		<h3>Project Explorer</h3>
<p><strong>Project Explorer</strong> view is where you can explore and organize the contents of your projects. Screen files (files with <strong>.screen</strong> extension) have a distinctive icon in this view. Double-click the file to open it using the <a href="ch03.html">Screen Editor</a>.</p>
<p>Drag &amp; drop screen and image files from <strong>Project Explorer</strong> directly into <a href="ch03.html">Screen Editor</a> or <a href="ch04.html">Storyboard Editor</a>. Dropping screen files into <a href="ch03.html">Screen Editor</a> will automatically include them as <a href="ch31.html">components</a>. Drag &amp; drop can also be used to quickly create <a href="ch38.html">screen links</a>. Before using drag &amp; drop make sure to go to <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view and uncheck the <strong>Link with Editor</strong> option (<img src="img/link_to_editor.gif" title="Link with Editor" alt="Link with Editor" />).</p>
<p>Copy &amp; Paste screen and image files from <strong>Project Explorer</strong> into <a href="ch03.html">Screen Editor</a> to include them as <a href="ch31.html">components</a> or <a href="ch28.html">images</a>. Also screens can be added this way to <a href="ch04.html">Storyboard Editor</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Project Explorer</strong> view lets you rename and move files around. Make use of this feature and don&#8217;t be afraid to reorganize your projects &#8211; all cross-file links will be automatically updated.</p>
<p>Here you can also configure project references that are useful when <a href="ch31.html">working with components</a>. Right-click on a project and then select <strong>Properties &gt; Project References</strong>.</p>
<p>You can control how Project Explorer responds to single and double clicks. By default files are opened on double click. You can change this by going to <strong>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; General</strong> where you&#8217;ll find the <strong>Open Mode</strong> setting.</p>
<p>Projects can be organized in <strong>Working Sets</strong>. Working Sets let you see only a subset of your projects and they are helpful when you work with many projects. You can create different Working Sets and then select which Working Set to display. Use drop-down menu in view&#8217;s toolbar to select and configure Working Sets.</p>
