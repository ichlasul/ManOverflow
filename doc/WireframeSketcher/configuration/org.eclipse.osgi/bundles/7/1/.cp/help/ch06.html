		<h3>Palette</h3>
<p>The <strong>Palette</strong> view is where you&#8217;ll find the widgets to use in your wireframes. You can change it&#8217;s position to the left side of the <strong>Screen Editor</strong>.</p>
<p>Various palette layout settings can be adjusted from the context menu. Right-click inside the palette to get access to it. You can make thumbnail icons smaller and make widgets display in a list. There is also a <strong>Customize&#8230;</strong> option that allows you to hide widgets in the palette.</p>
<p>You can place your own widgets and images in the palette by placing them in the &#8220;assets&#8221; folder in the root of your project. If needed, the location of the assets folder can be changed per project. To do this right-click on the project in the <a href="ch05.html">Project Explorer</a>, choose <strong>Properties &gt; Wireframing Settings</strong> and change the <strong>Assets Folder</strong> setting.</p>
<p>Use <a href="ch15.html">Mockups Gallery</a> to add useful, pre-built assets by selecting <strong>Add Assets from Mockups Gallery&#8230;</strong> from the context menu.</p>
<p>The palette can also be open in its own view using <strong>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Palette</strong>. This gives you more layout options. You can even make the palette float above the editor area using detached views.</p>
<p>Palette items can be filtered using the search field. You can also filter by a pre-defined category using the category tree below the search field.</p>
<p>Palette is keyboard friendly. Click on a widget and then use <strong>Arrows</strong> and <strong>Tab</strong> to navigate around. Type a letter to quickly jump to a widget that starts with it. Press <strong>Enter</strong> to add the selected widget.</p>
