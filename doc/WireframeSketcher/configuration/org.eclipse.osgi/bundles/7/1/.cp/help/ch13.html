		<h2>Working with Projects</h2>
<p>Projects let you organize related wireframing resources in a folder structure. Projects map to directories in the file system. When you create a project it&#8217;s default location is in <strong>Workspace</strong> folder. Workspace is located in your home directory and it&#8217;s where WireframeSketcher stores all the data about your projects. Optionally, you can specify a different location for a project by deselecting <strong>Use default location</strong> checkbox in project wizard. Use <a href="ch05.html">Project Explorer</a> view to manage projects.</p>
<p>A project can be either open or closed. When a project is closed, its contents cannot be changed. The resources of a closed project will not appear in the Project Explorer, but the resources still reside on the local file system. Closed projects require less memory. When a project is open, the structure of the project can be changed and you will see its contents.</p>
<p>Projects can be organized in <strong>Working Sets</strong>. Working Sets let you see only a subset of your projects and they are helpful when you work with many projects. You can create different Working Sets and then select which Working Set to display in the <a href="ch05.html">Project Explorer</a> view.</p>
