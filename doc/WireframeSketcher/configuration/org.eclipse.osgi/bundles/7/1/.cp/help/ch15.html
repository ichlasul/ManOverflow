		<h3>Managing Project Assets</h3>
<p>You can place your own widgets and images in the <a href="ch06.html">palette</a> by placing them in the &#8220;assets&#8221; folder in the root of your project. If needed, the location of the assets folder can be changed per project. To do this right-click on the project in the <a href="ch05.html">Project Explorer</a>, choose <strong>Properties &gt; Wireframing Settings</strong> and change the <strong>Assets Folder</strong> setting.</p>
<p>Assets can be shared between projects using project references. Project references can be configured using <a href="ch05.html">Project Explorer</a>. Right-click on a project and then select <strong>Properties &gt; Project References</strong>. This mechanism lets you place assets in a global project and then reference it in other projects that also need those assets.</p>
<p>Additional assets can be installed from <a href="http://wireframesketcher.com/mockups">Mockups Gallery</a>. There you&#8217;ll find iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone stencils, various icon packs and more. Use <a href="http://wireframesketcher.com/mockups">Mockups Gallery</a> to jump-start your work and save some valuable time. Actually project templates from <a href="ch14.html">Wireframe Project</a> wizard are just assets from <strong>Mockups Gallery</strong> that you can also install yourself.</p>
<p><a href="http://wireframesketcher.com/mockups">Mockups Gallery</a> can be open in WireframeSketcher by selecting <strong>Help &gt; Add Assets from Mockups Gallery&#8230;</strong> or the same action in <a href="ch06.html">Palette&#8217;s</a> context menu. Simply navigate to the desired asset, click the download link and a wizard will open to help you add it to your project.</p>
<p>You can create your own assets such as <a href="ch31.html">components</a>, <a href="ch30.html">icons</a> and <a href="ch28.html">images</a>.</p>
