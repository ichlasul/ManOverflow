		<h3>Selection</h3>
<p>To select a widget just click on it. For multiple selection hold the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key while clicking to toggle the selected state of a widget. Hold <strong>Shift</strong> while clicking to add a widget to the current selection.</p>
<p>Selected widgets have a blue rectangle around them &#8211; move handle, and white or black squares which are resize handles. One widget that has black resize handles is called primary or anchor selection. This is the last widget selected. Relative actions such as align and match size use primary selection as their reference.</p>

<p>The <strong>Marquee</strong> tool gives you another selection method. Use it to drag a bounding box around widgets you want to select. <strong>Marquee</strong> tool activates automatically when you start dragging in an empty space of the editor canvas. If the screen is crowded and has little empty space then use <strong>F4</strong> <a href="ch39.html">keyboard shortcut</a> to quickly activate the <strong>Marquee</strong> tool. Use <strong>F3</strong> to go back to the <strong>Select</strong> tool.</p>
<p>You can also select widgets in the <a href="ch08.html">Outline</a> view which keeps in sync with the editor&#8217;s selection.</p>
