		<h3>Moving and Resizing</h3>
<p>To move selected widgets just drag them using the mouse. Use <strong>Arrows</strong> to adjust the position of widgets in increments of 2px using the keyboard. <strong>Ctrl+Arrows</strong> let you adjust the size. <strong>Shift+Arrows</strong> and <strong>Shift+Ctrl+Arrows</strong> let you do the same thing in increments of 20px.</p>
<p>To resize selected widgets just grab with the mouse one of the handles and drag it. Some widgets cannot be resized in one or both directions. In this case handles will only appear for directions that work.</p>
<p>Move and resize operations snap to guides, grid and geometry (smart guides). Use <strong>Alt</strong> key to temporarily disable snapping. Snapping behavior can be adjusted in <a href="ch53.html">preferences</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the widgets are capable of calculating their size automatically. For example the <strong>Button</strong> widget will adjust its size to fit the text. If a widget is resized explicitly then it will keep this new size. You can use the <strong>Auto-Size</strong> action to turn back on the auto-sizing behavior.</p>
<p>During the move and resize operations you can see the resulting position and size displayed in the status bar. The same information is also displayed in a small overlayed tooltip when the widget&#8217;s size allows it.</p>
<p>For more precision use <strong>Align</strong>, <strong>Size</strong> and <strong>Distribute</strong> actions available from the from the <a href="ch10.html">Toolbar</a> and the <a href="ch11.html">Context Menu</a>.</p>
<p>You can lock widgets in place (<strong>Ctrl+L</strong>) to avoid moving or resizing them by accident.</p>
