		<h3>Grouping Widgets</h3>
<p>You can group widgets so that they can be manipulated all at once. This is also useful for creating reusable components. Hit <strong>Ctrl+G</strong> to group the selected widgets. Use <strong>Ctrl+Shift+G</strong> to ungroup. You can assign a name to a widget group. This is useful when creating reusable <a href="ch31.html">components</a>.</p>
<p>You can &#8220;enter groups&#8221; to edit their contents using <strong>double-click</strong>. Hit <strong>Escape</strong> to exit group editing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to control how widgets behave when their parent group is resized. This is done by anchoring widgets to the edges or the center of the group. There are 5 possible anchor settings for each direction. These are <strong>None</strong>, <strong>Left</strong>, <strong>Center</strong>, <strong>Right</strong> and <strong>Left Right</strong> (or <strong>Fill</strong>) for horizontal direction, and <strong>Top</strong>, <strong>Middle</strong>, <strong>Bottom</strong> and <strong>Top Bottom</strong> (or <strong>Fill</strong>) for vertical direction. By combining vertical and horizontal anchors it&#8217;s possible to make the widget stay in corners, center or fill the parent group which is useful when designing reusable <a href="ch31.html">components</a>.</p>
<p>Anchor settings have the following interpretation:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>None</strong> &#8211; widget&#8217;s position and size are scaled proportionally with the group&#8217;s size. This is the default setting.</li>
	<li><strong>Left</strong>, <strong>Top</strong>, <strong>Right</strong>, <strong>Bottom</strong> &#8211; widget maintains it&#8217;s distance from the group&#8217;s edge. Widget&#8217;s size is preserved unless it&#8217;s anchored to the opposite edges in which case it will stretch.</li>
	<li><strong>Center</strong>, <strong>Middle</strong> &#8211; widget maintains it&#8217;s distance from the group&#8217;s center. Note that this does not mean that the widget is actually centered unless it was centered manually.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anchors are specified by using <strong>Object &gt; Anchors&#8230;</strong> entry from the <a href="ch12.html">top menu</a> or using the anchor drop-down in <a href="ch07.html">Properties View</a>. The anchor drop-down offers quick access to the most useful (but not all) anchor combinations. Click the anchor icon for more fine grained control.</p>
