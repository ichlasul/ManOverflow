		<h2>Working with Storyboards</h2>
<p>A storyboard is a sequence of screens that shows how the UI changes in time as the result of user actions. For example you can use them to show the steps of a checkout process or prototype a wizard dialog. You can also use them for more complex things like UI animations produced by <span class="caps">AJAX</span> events in a web application. Storyboards are saved in files with <strong>.story</strong> extension.</p>
<p>Storyboards provide a screenflow view that lets you visualize complex navigation flows between screens in a more graphical way.</p>
<p>You can also use storyboards for their multi-page <span class="caps">PDF</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span> export capability. Just create a storyboard with desired screens and then <a href="ch41.html">export them</a>.</p>
<p>Use F5 to launch a full-screen <a href="ch51.html">presentation</a> of your storyboard.</p>
